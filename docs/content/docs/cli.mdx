Xal-Node also offers a CLI application so you can use xal-node to authenticate while you can consume the tokens in your scripts.

To install the CLI, use the following command:

```npm install -g xal-node```

Once the package is installed the application should be available using `xbox-auth`.

### Available commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `xbox-auth auth` | Runs the authentication flow and provides an URL to login to. |
| `xbox-auth show` | Shows the current status of the tokens and if they are expired or not. |
| `xbox-auth refresh` | Refreshes the current stored tokens to new up to date tokens without running the full flow again. |
| `xbox-auth tokens` | Fetches all tokens for use with xCloud and xHome |
| `xbox-auth logout` | Removes the current stored tokens | 

Once authenticted it will create a new file named `.xbox.tokens.json` which you can use to retrieve the tokens.
